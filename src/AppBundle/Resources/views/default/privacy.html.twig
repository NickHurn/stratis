employment and employee background screening services.

accordance with the UK Government Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA)
and also ensuring that data received about any European Union or
Swiss national is handled in accordance with the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). If there is any conflict between the
policies in this Privacy Policy and the DPA or GDPR policies, the GDPR
shall prevail.
